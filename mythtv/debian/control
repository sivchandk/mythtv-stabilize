  - Themable, semi-transparent on-screen display
  - Electronic program guide
  - Scheduled recording of TV programs
  - Resolution of conflicts between scheduled recordings
  - Basic video editing
 .
 This package will install a complete MythTV client/server environment on a
 single system, including a MySQL server.
 .
 The powerpc packages were compiled with altivec and sparc packages with
 ultra-sparc support.
