mythtv (0.24~rc1-0.0) experimental; urgency=low

  Upgrading from a previous version of MythTV to 0.24 are required to rescan
  for audio devices on their frontends (in the audio settings menu) after
  upgrading due to the rewritten audio framework which can conflict with
  legacy settings.

mythtv (0.20-svn20070223-0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  The cron.daily file has been removed because we are killing zap2it's
